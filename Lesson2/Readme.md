## Exercises
In this lesson we are playing with WPF :bowtie:

**The first** exercise name HelloWorld_WPF is just a simple Hello World program that dispays the text "Hello World" by click of a button.

**The second** one is about loading a csv file and showing in listbox. I've chosen to show it in listview as it's much nicer that way :innocent:
